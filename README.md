## Scripting
### surveyor scripts
These scripts are run to map a location, providing packet loss at a specified bandwidth associated with coordinates.<br/>
This capability will be expanded to show a map of the location and provide other network statistics.
<br/>
1. Once cloned, run scripting/server/surveyor_s on the server side (raspberry pi).
2. Run scripting/client/surveyor_c on the client side (laptop for ease in testing purposes, will be a raspberry pi in final product). **You can run `./surveyor_s -h` to view possible flags.**
